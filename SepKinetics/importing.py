'''# TODO:
-comment the code more  DONE
-use argv in __main__ or hardcode .csv for testing? DONE
-import .xlsx instead of .csv (comes from clarity as .xlsx)
-save 3D plots as HTML
-fix double importing
-fix 3D y-axis
-add axis labels
-add monocolor histogram for 2D plot
-add plotting series of histograms (see PythonProject folder in chrome)
